{"name":"Micopi","tagline":"Mobile app that generates pictures for phone contacts","body":"micopi\r\n======\r\n\r\nGeneral Description\r\n===================\r\nMicopi allows you to assign an image to every person in your telephone's contact list. So if you do not happen to have a (decent) photo of them, you can use the app to simply generate one.\r\nMicopi does not use a random number generator to create these images. It exclusively uses contact data such as the name, the telephone number or the e-mail address and turns these into geometric figures and colours. This way, all of your contacts have their unique image.\r\nThis app has been thoroughly tested but we recommend making a backup of your most precious contact pictures, just in case.\r\n\r\nGoogle PlayStore Entry\r\n======================\r\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easytarget.micopi\r\n\r\nDevelopment Description\r\n=======================\r\nAll files use the Apache License Version 2.0 (see http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).\r\nThe app is currently in a stable release state and available for free for all Android devices running version 2.0.1 or higher (API 6).
